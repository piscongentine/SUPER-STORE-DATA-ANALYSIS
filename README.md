---

### 🔹 Step 7: Pie Chart Visualization (Region vs Profit)

A **Pie Chart** was created with:
- Dimension: `Region`
- Measure: `Profit (Sum)`

This visualization shows **profit contribution by region**.

---

### 🔹 Step 9: Pareto Chart Analysis (80/20 Rule)

A **Pareto Chart** was used to identify:
- High-impact regions
- Cumulative contribution using the **80/20 principle**
